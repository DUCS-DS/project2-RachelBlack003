# Sp25Proj2
Project 2 for Spring '25 Data Structures

My framerate reached 60 after implementing the changes.

The runtime complexity for the for-loop at the bottom becomes around 20n (more if you count the code inside the second for-loop) because it checks exactly 20 elements for each node. Meanwhile, the runtime complexity of the sorting algorithm is nlog(n). The total runtime complexity comes out to about nlog(n) + 20n. So the big O runtime complexity is nlog(n).
